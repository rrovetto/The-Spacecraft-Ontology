# The Spacecraft Ontology
An ontology describing categories of spacecraft, their subsystems, subsystem components, their characteristics, and interrelations.
Alternative titles are:

## Description

### Scope
The Spacecraft Ontology represents types of spacecraft, their components and subsystems, characteristics thereof, etc. It provides a set of categories, optionally defined with local definitions. 

### Architecture
A self-contained module, usable by itself, but also part of the author's wider [space domain knowledge modeling](https://purl.org/space-ontology) suite of ontologies and other knowledge organization systems.

### Purpose
* To formally represent spacecraft and their parts in a computable manner for various applicaiton, including artificial intelligence
* To provide an accurate formal terminology and catergorization system that may serve as standards for the spaceflight community
* To offer conceptual clarification and disambiguation where desired
* ...  

### Status
* In-progress as circumstances permit. Subject to revision. 
* As a unfunded personal project since inception, continued development is dependent on circumstances. Formal support is needed to complete and sustain development to realize the full project vision. The vision is ambitious, multidisciplinary and detailed. [Contact the author](https://ontospace.wordpress.com/contact) to formally support the project in some way. Donations are welcome at the below web-links.  
* ACTIVELY NEEDING: financial support, employer support, stable environment with resources to development and continue learning, etc.
* Desired as my PhD or other graduate project

## Support / Contribute / Desiderata - How you can help 
As an unfunded personal project, you can help by offerring financial support, employment opportunities, graduate study opportunities whereby this can be part of my thesis or projects, co-authorship on papers or proposal, mentorship, voluntary technical expertise/servies for desired functionalities of my project, relevant datasets to apply the ontology to, and to be a user of the ontology(s).

## Example Applicaiton 
Some of the definitions and the categorization model have influenced and been applied to [national-level standards](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/4.106286.001), see also [this contribution example]().

## Access
* Contact if interested in purchasing use 
* With sufficient formal support, the ontology may become open
